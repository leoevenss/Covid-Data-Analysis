pre requisite: data-all.json(from covid portal:https://api.covid19india.org/v4/data-all.json), neigbor-districts.json(givenin assignment) 

1.neigbor-districts-modified.json(file after preprocessing such as merging,spelling correections of the neigbour-districts)

#got 627 districts after doing preprocessing.

#please follow the sequence of execution



Question1):execute neighbor-districts-modified.sh 
Output:  neighbor-districts-modified.csv (contains the districts and their corresponding id's starting from 101 and sorted)

Question2) execute case-generator.sh
Output: alldata_base.csv ( having data of all cases from 15 march to 5 sept), cases-week.csv,cases-month.csv,cases-overall.csv


#please do not delete any csv files generated as i have used it in subsequent questions

Question3)execute edge-generator.sh
Output: edge-graph.csv

Question4)execute neighbor-generator.sh
Output: neighbor-month.csv,neighbor-overall.csv,neighbor-week.csv

Question5)execute state-generator.sh
Output :state-month.csv,state-overall.csv,state-week.csv

Question6)execute zscore-generator.sh
Output :zscore-month.csv,zscore-overall.csv,zscore-week.csv


Question7) execute method-spot-generator.sh
Output: method-spot-month.csv,method-spot-overall.csv,method-spot-week.csv


Question8) execute top-generator.sh
Output: top-month.csv,top-overall.csv,top-week.csv

processing done:
merged districts of delhi,mumbai,telangana,goa,manipur,sikkim,assam.  removed konkan division and noklak.

appended statecode at the end of duplicate names to sort them

aurangabad->aurangabadbr,aurangabadmh
balrampur->balrampurct,balrampurup
bilaspur->bilaspurct,bilaspurhp
hamirpur->hamirpurhp,hamirpurup
pratapgarh->pratapgarhrj,pratapgarhup

used fuzzywuzzy library to match the data from neigbor-districts.json and covid portal data and replaced the mismatched names and old names

1. missing values - the missing values for districts on certain dates are handled by putting them 0.
2.the cases for week(25),month(7),overall(1) are generated
3.the undirected edge graph is generated and sorted .
4.the neighbor mean and neighbor std are calculated from the neighbors of each district
5.the statemean and statestd are calculated based on all the other districts in the state - used alldata_base.csv file here to get state information.
6.the zscores are calculated and for those with standard deviation 0 -> zscore are considered 0
7.the hotspot,coldspot from neigbour and state files( 4,5 questions) are generated
8.the top 5 hotspots and coldspots generated by considering the output of 6th file, sorting zscores and removing  zscores with 0 values. the weeks / months having no hotspots are replaced by '-'.
9. created the readme.txt file.
10.created a brief report on the values obtained from the assignment
